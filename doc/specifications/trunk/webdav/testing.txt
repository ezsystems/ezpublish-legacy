WebDAV in eZ Publish
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document describes the unit tests for WebDAV, and how to configure those
tests.


Server Configuration
====================

The eZ Publish installation must be configured to process all WebDAV requests
through webdav.php.

See http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/4_0/features/webdav for
more information about how to activate WebDAV support on an eZ Publish
installation.

In addition, WebDAV support must be enabled in webdav.ini::

  [GeneralSettings]
  EnableWebDAV=true

For each siteaccess there should be a webdav.ini.append.php which specifies
the start node of that siteaccess::

 [GeneralSettings]
 StartNode=2

WebDAV Logging is enabled by (in webdav.ini or in overwrites)::

 [GeneralSettings]
 Logging=enable

The locations of the WebDAV log files are var/log/webdav.log (from webdav.php)
and var/log/<siteaccess>/log/webdav.log (from ezwebdavcontentbackend.php).

For multiple siteaccesses, the setting PathPrefix and PathPrefixExclude should
be used in site.ini and overrides of site.ini::

  [SiteAccessSettings]

  # Hides this part from the start of the url alias
  PathPrefix=

  # Which URLs to exclude from being affected by PathPrefix setting.
  # URLs containing the specified texts after siteaccess name will not be affected by PathPrefix
  PathPrefixExclude[]
  #PathPrefixExclude[]=media

By default, the WebDAV files are sent to Trash when deleted. The administrator
of the site is responsible to empty the Trash. If you want to remove the files
directly (without using the Trash), this setting must be changed in content.ini
::

  [RemoveSettings]
  # delete or trash
  DefaultRemoveAction=delete

To change the way file names are created when uploading files, use the
TransformationGroup setting in site.ini and its overrides::

  [URLTranslator]
  TransformationGroup=urlalias
  # Uncomment this to get the new-style url aliases with Unicode support
  #TransformationGroup=urlalias_iri
  # Uncomment this to get the old-style url aliases
  #TransformationGroup=urlalias_compat


Regression test system
======================

The unit tests reside in tests/tests/kernel/private/webdav.

The file backend_content_regression_test.php contains the test class
eZWebDAVContentBackendRegressionTest which extends ezcTestRegressionTest. This
class is in the trunk of eZ Components, and it is not present in PEAR
installations or in the released packages.

The normal webdav.php of the eZ Publish installation is NOT used. Instead
the code is duplicated in backend_content_regression_test.php.

By inheriting from ezcTestRegressionTest, eZWebDAVContentBackendRegressionTest
can create tests dynamically by iterating recursively through the directory
tree regression, where for each .request file found it creates a test.

Each .request file has other files with the same name and different extensions
attached.

Do not name the test files with characters which cannot appear in function
names in PHP. For each .request file a test function is created dynamically
with the same name as the file minus the extension.


.request
--------

Required file. It is included in the test system via include. For each .request
file a test function is created, and an eZ Publish folder is created under
/$GLOBALS['ezc_siteaccess']/Content. The folder is removed after each test.

Because WebDAV normally outputs information via the header() function, some
hacks were made in wrappers.php in the tests/tests/kernel/private/webdav
folder. The content output from WebDAV is being redirected to the global
variable $GLOBALS['ezc_response_body'] which will be compared with the
text content of the .expected file.


.expected
---------

Required file. The contents of these files are compared against the output
which results from running the test with input from the .request file.

WebDAV commands which return XML (PROPFIND) can make use of special strings
which will be replaced before comparing the result (to allow portability
between different test machines). These special strings are:

  @ezc_siteaccess@
    The siteaccess defined in site.ini and which is used as the base of the
	WebDAV tests. Change this in the setUp() function in the file
    backend_content_regression_test.php, value $GLOBALS['ezc_siteaccess'].

  @ezc_webdav_host@
    The host of the WebDAV machine the tests are running on. Usually it is
    webdav.ezp. Change this in the setUp() function in the file
    backend_content_regression_test.php, value $GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_host'].

  @ezc_webdav_testfolder@
    The name of the current .request file, minus the extension.  This is
    assigned automatically from the test system. An eZ Publish folder
    with this name is created automatically before the .request file is
    included, under the folder /$GLOBALS['ezc_siteaccess']/Content/.


.txt or .jpg or other extensions
--------------------------------

Optional file. If the .request file needs to create a file or image object
in eZ Publish, it can do so by specifying this file (with the name
$GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_testfolder'] followed by the needed extension).


.body
-----

Optional file.

Used for WebDAV commands which return a binary content in addition to normal
HTTP headers. The binary content (eg. image) is put in the .body file, and
the test will automatically append it to the normal output from the .expected
file.


Unit tests
==========

Each WebDAV command (COPY, GET, PROPFIND etc) has its own directory in which
its regression tests are kept. For each command there are 2 directories:

  correct
    Tests which return "normal" output. This means for example a GET command
    on an existing file which returns '200 OK' and the contents of the file.

  incorrect
    Tests which return "abnormal" output. This means for example a GET
    command on a missing file which returns '404 Not Found'.

Each .request file can make use of some global variables in the test:

  $GLOBALS['ezc_siteaccess']
    The siteaccess defined in site.ini and which is used as the base of the
	WebDAV tests. Change this in the setUp() function in the file
    backend_content_regression_test.php, value $GLOBALS['ezc_siteaccess'].

  $GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_host']
    The host of the WebDAV machine the tests are running on. Usually it is
    webdav.ezp. Change this in the setUp() function in the file
    backend_content_regression_test.php, value $GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_host'].

  $GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_testfolder']
    The name of the current .request file, minus the extension. This is
    assigned automatically from the test system. An eZ Publish folder is
    with this name is created automatically before the .request file is
    included, under the folder $GLOBALS['ezc_siteaccess']/Content/.

  $GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_testfolderid']
    The node_id corresponding to $GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_testfolder']. This
    is used for example to create a file, folder, image etc under the
    current folder ($GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_testfolder']).

  $GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_username'] and $GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_password']
    These are assigned automatically to the default values 'admin' and
    'publish' (change this in backend_content_regression_test.php in
    setUp(). To tests abnormal output caused by providing a wrong
    username and password, change these values in the .request file.

  $GLOBALS['ezc_post_body']
    This is used for WebDAV commands which are required to have a body
    (eg. PROPFIND needs an XML body in which it specifies which properties
    it requests). Needs the $_SERVER variables HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH and
    CONTENT_TYPE.


The server variables will be set directly in the .request files:

  $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']
    Required. Specifies which WebDAV method the .request file is testing.
    Possible values: COPY, DELETE, GET, HEAD, MKCOL, MOVE, OPTIONS, PROPFIND,
    PROPPATCH, PUT.

  $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
    Required. Use the global variables listed above to create portable tests.

  $_SERVER['HTTP_DESTINATION']
    Required for WebDAV commands COPY and MOVE. Use the globals variables
    listed above to create portable tests. The full URL needs to be here,
    so use also 'http://' . $GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_host'] in front of siteaccess.

  $_SERVER['HTTP_DEPTH']
    Needed for some WebDAV commands. Possible values: '0', '1' or 'infinity'.

  $_SERVER['HTTP_OVERWRITE']
    Needed for some WebDAV commands (COPY, MOVE). Possible values: 'F' (do
    not overwrite) or 'T' (overwrite).

  $_SERVER['HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH']
    Required for WebDAV commands which need a body (PROPFIND, PROPPATCH). It
    can have any value (it is not enforced).

  $_SERVER['CONTENT_TYPE']
    Required for WebDAV commands which need a body (PROPFIND, PROPPATCH). For
    XML body use 'application/xml'.

  $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']
    Not used for now (value is set to 'cadaver/0.22.5 neon/0.26.3') but tests
    can be written in the future for each relevant WebDAV client.

Change these values in backend_content_regression_test.php in the setUp()
function to make the tests work on another machine::

  $GLOBALS['ezc_siteaccess'] = 'plain_site_user';
  $GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_username'] = 'admin';
  $GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_password'] = 'publish';
  $GLOBALS['ezc_webdav_host'] = 'webdav.ezp';


Failing tests
=============

Some tests will fail on different machine for some causes:

  PROPFIND
    The test testPropFindFolderLevel0Depth1 will fail because it expects the
    siteaccess second_site to be present. A fix will come for this.

Tests can be skipped by uncommenting their respective line in the function
skip() in backend_content_regression_test.php.


Current issues
==============

Moving/Copying content between 2 siteaccesses
---------------------------------------------

This is not possible yet (409 Conflict is returned), but some clients like
BitKinex behave strangely by trying moving/copying again, with the source
file disappearing, and the destination file not appearing.
