Improved multi-language in eZ publish
=====================================

:Author: Jan Borsodi, Jan Kudlicka
:Revision: 5

The current implementation (3.7) of multi-language support in eZ publish has
some shortcomings. The improvements to the system are described in the
following sections, they describe the problem and provides a way to solve it,
some even has a suggested technical solution.

This document replaces the `old multi-language specification`_.

New concepts
````````````

Problem:
  The current concept keeps all languages inside one version and will allow
  only one person to modify their data. This makes it impossible for multiple
  persons to edit each language separately and at the same time, instead they
  will have to wait for one language to be updated and published.

To remedy this the languages will be made more self-contained and
independent. This allows languages to be created and edited separately by
multiple users, it also simplifies things like approval since you can consider
one language only.

The major changes to content model are:

- A user only edits one version and language at a time. UI changes will be made
  to make it possible to edit multiple languages of an object.
- Objects can be created in any language on any site-access, the first language
  of the object will be recorded.
- Objects can be translated to as many languages as necessary.
- Available languages can be controlled per site-access, allowing languages to
  be filtered.

See attachment for `an overview`_ of the tables, new tables are highlighted in blue.

.. _an overview: multi-language_datamodel.png

Global translations
-------------------

A new table (*ezcontent_language*) is introduced which replaces the
old table (*ezcontent_translation*).
Each entry in the table gets a new *id* which is a representation of
the bitnumber as a value. ie. 2^bitnum. Id 1 (2^0) is reserved by
the system.
The language is stored with a locale code (e.g. nor-NO) and a name, in
addition it also has the field *disabled* which can be used to disable
a language on the site.

The maximum number of languages is 30.

The global table looks like the following::

  ezcontent_language
  +----+----------+--------+--------------------------+
  | id | disabled | locale | name                     |
  +----+----------+--------+--------------------------+
  |  2 |        0 | eng-GB | English (United Kingdom) |
  |  4 |        0 | rus-RU | Russian                  |
  |  8 |        0 | slk-SK | Slovak                   |
  | 16 |        0 | eng-US | English (American)       |
  | 32 |        0 | nor-NO | Norwegian (Bokmal)       |
  +----+----------+--------+--------------------------+


Initial language
----------------

Whenever an object is created for the first time it will store the language the
object was created in. This allows the system to find one language on the
object when none of the others can be used (e.g. filtered away). The value will
be stored in the field *initial_language_id* using the *language_id* from
the *ezcontent_language* table.

The new field will look like::

  ezcontentobject
  +-----+----------------------+
  | id  | initial_language_id  |
  +-----+----------------------+
  |   1 |                    2 | (eng-GB)
  |   2 |                    2 | (eng-GB)
  |   5 |                    2 | (eng-GB)
  |  10 |                    2 | (eng-GB)
  |  42 |                   16 | (eng-US)
  |  44 |                    4 | (rus-RU)
  +-----+----------------------+

Available languages
-------------------

Problem:
  There is currently no record of what languages are available on an object,
  unless one accesses the attributes.

To make it easier to figure out which languages are available on an object a
new attribute is added which returns the languages as an array of
locale codes.

The new attribute is called *available_languages* and will use the
*language_mask* field combined with the global language table to
figure out the correct codes.

The result of this attribute is shown below::

  Object  1: array( 'eng-GB' )
  Object  2: array( 'eng-GB', 'slk-SK' )
  Object  5: array( 'eng-GB', 'rus-RU' )
  Object 10: array( 'eng-GB' )
  Object 42: array( 'eng-US' )
  Object 44: array( 'rus-RU' )

Language priority and filtering
-------------------------------

Problem:
  The current model did not have a proper prioritization of the available
  languages. Often you will want to limit the languages shown for a site-access
  and also choose which is the preferred.

With the new concepts is no longer directly known which languages to use per
object, instead this must be calculated based on the requested languages in
prioritized order and the available languages (in object).

The requested languages might be different per site-access so the solution must
be fast and scalable.

A language priority list is basically a list of languages to show and the first
language will get higher priority than the second and so on...

Filtering languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To perform proper language filtering and prioritization a new bitfield
algorithm is introduced. All languages used in an eZ publish instance
are identified by powers of 2 to be able to use bitmap *and* for selecting
rows containing information on objects or attributes in prioritized languages.
Id 1 (2^0) is reserved for marking objects which are always available.

To show how the bitfield algorithm works, let's have a look at the
ezcontentobject table. A new field is introduced to identify languages in which
last published version of an object exist. This field contains the sum of id
values of these languages. Because id values are powers of 2 it is possible to
identify the languages and/or to select objects published in any of prioritized
languages::

  ezcontentobject
  +-----+---------------+
  | id  | language_mask |
  +-----+---------------+
  |   1 |             3 | %00011
  |   2 |            10 | %01010
  |   5 |             6 | %00110
  |  10 |             2 | %00010
  |  42 |            16 | %10000
  |  44 |             4 | %00100
  +-----+---------------+

Note that language_mask 3 in the first row denotes that the language is English
(id 2) and the object is always available (id 1), even if the prioritized list
does not contain English (eng-GB).

For example, to filter objects which exist in Slovak (id 8) or Russian (id 4),
we might run the following SQL::

  SELECT id FROM ezcontentobject
  WHERE language_mask & 12 > 0

Whenever the available languages change for the object (i.e. new version
published) it the bitfield is updated.

Another bitfield is used in tables containing the language_code attribute. This
bitfield represents the same information as the language_code but uses the id
from ezcontent_language table to make easy to select correct rows with respect
to the list of prioritized languages.

Consider the following example::

  ezcontentobject_attribute
  +----+---------+------------------+---------------+-------------+
  | id | version | contentobject_id | language_code | language_id |
  +----+---------+------------------+---------------+-------------+
  | 10 |       1 |                1 |        eng-GB |           3 |
  | 31 |       1 |                2 |        eng-GB |           2 |
  | 32 |       1 |                2 |        slk-SK |           8 |
  | 46 |       1 |                5 |        eng-GB |           2 |
  | 47 |       1 |                5 |        rus-RU |           4 |
  +----+---------+------------------+---------------+-------------+   

To select content object attributes in prioritized languages, we might use a
single SQL containing a condition using bitfields, bitmap *and* operation and
simple arithmetic operations (multiplication, division and sum).

Consider the following prioritized language list: slk-SK, eng-GB. To check if
the attribute is in slk-SK we can check if language_id & 8 is not zero etc.
If we perform the following operation::

  ( language_id & 8 ) / 2
  + language_id & 2
  + language_id & 1

we will get the bitfield value having 1 on 0th bit if the attribute is always
available (i.e. the object containing it have to be shown even if it is not in
any of prioritized languages), having 1 on 1st bit if the attribute is
available in eng-GB and having 1 on 2nd bit if the attribute is available in
slk-SK.

To find out if the attribute is in one of the prioritized languages and that
there is no translation of this attribute in more prioritized language, we
select those which hold the following condition::

  ( (     language_mask - language_id ) & 8 ) / 2 
      + ( language_mask - language_id ) & 2 
      + ( language_mask - language_id ) & 1
  < ( language_id & 8 ) / 2
    + language_id & 2
    + language_id & 1

where *language_mask* is the ezcontentobject attribute containing the bitfield of
available languages.

All languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To solve the issues with cronjobs and admin interfaces which must always list
all available languages we introduce a special setting. When used the SQLs will
include all objects even if it does not have any of the other languages.

The first bit of the bitfield will be examined when this is enabled since it is
reserved for this task.

Translated attributes
---------------------

With the new database concepts it will be possible for multiple users editing
the same object but in different languages (and versions). This means that
storage of attributes needs to be changed since one version does not reflect
all languages anymore.

The system will remove the current_version fields from the DB and instead
introduce a *status* field on the attributes (same to version status) which is
used to fetch the published data. When content/edit stores the data it will
only do it for the language it edits.

In short it means that for one version of an object there will only be
attribute data for one language.

The table will then look like::

  ezcontentobject_attribute
  +----+------------------+---------+---------------+-------------+--------+
  | id | contentobject_id | version | language_code | language_id | status |
  +----+------------------+---------+---------------+-------------+--------+
  |  7 |                5 |       1 | eng-GB        |           2 |      2 |
  |  8 |                5 |       1 | eng-GB        |           2 |      2 |
  |  7 |                5 |       2 | rus-RU        |           4 |      1 |
  |  8 |                5 |       2 | rus-RU        |           4 |      1 |
  |  7 |                5 |       3 | eng-GB        |           2 |      1 |
  |  8 |                5 |       3 | eng-GB        |           2 |      1 |
  |  7 |                5 |       4 | slk-SK        |           8 |      0 |
  |  8 |                5 |       4 | slk-SK        |           8 |      0 |
  | 22 |               44 |       1 | eng-GB        |           2 |      1 |
  | 23 |               44 |       1 | eng-GB        |           2 |      1 |
  +----+------------------+---------+---------------+-------------+--------+

Node assignment
---------------

As with `Translated attributes`_ there are now issues with the node assignments as
well. For instance if two users edits the same object in different languages at
the same time they will each get a copy of the published node assignment, if
they both modify it there will be conflicts when publishing.

The avoid this conflict the system will no longer allowed locations to be
added, removed or moved from the admin interface (except first version). Any
changes to locations will have to be done from the admin interface (locations
tab).

The system will track the operations in the the node-assignment table and merge
the result with the "live" tree structure to properly add, remove or move
nodes.


Object relations
----------------

Currently all relations are now stored only per version and not per
language. This means that there will be possible conflicts when two languages
are edited at the same time.

When publishing a version/language make sure the relation list is merged
together with the previous published data. This means that removed relations
must be marked as removed and not just deleted from the database.

Ignoring translation
--------------------

Problem:
  Some objects will need to always be available no matter which site-access is
  used. For instance user objects will need to be fetched even if they are not
  translated to the current language.

The current solution already has this class attributes but must be extended
further.

Class
~~~~~

Add a new field called *always_available* (default 0) to *class* table which
defines if objects of this class are always available. If this is set to 1 any
object created from it will always be available.
One of the major uses for this is for classes which needs to be always
available, for instance users or user groups.

When creating objects the objects will copy the current setting in the
class, any changes to the setting in the class will not affect existing
objects. This allows this setting to be switched per object at a later time.

By default eZ publish will come with this setting turned on for Folders, Users
and User Groups. In addition the system will make some objects always
available, meaning you cannot turn it off, currently this will be top-level
objects (Content, Users, Media) but may be extended in the future.

An extensible API will be made to support the *always available* switch, this
will allow extensions to determine which extra objects to marks as always
available.

Image datatype
++++++++++++++

The ezimage datatype got some changes to the XML storage due to the new
multi-language features. Now it always stores the <original> tag with
attribute ID, version and language and it is only updated when a new image
is uploaded.

An example::

  <original attribute_id="1530"
            attribute_version="1"
            attribute_language="eng-GB" />

This was required since the system will now copy over attribute data when
translation is disabled by using pure SQL commands.

Upgrade
-------

The system will still work with old entries having empty data in <original> but
will fill in the information if it is edited and published. Also old
non-translatable attributes have the <original> tag set correctly and will still
work.


Objects
~~~~~~~

When an object is always available the first bit (bit 0) will be set to 1. This
means it will be fetched no matter which priority list is used. It also means
that the object can still be translated. For objects which has none of the
available languages it will pick the initial language.

Workflows
`````````

Each version of an object can now only contain language, this means that there
is no need to change the workflow system or calls to the 'publish'
process. Instead the workflow events *approval* and *multiplexer* will get
support for filtering on language, they will store a language mask in the
*data_int2* DB field to choose which language to match on, a value of 0 means
any language.

Permissions
```````````

Problem:
  Now any user can create translations as long has he can create/edit the
  object. Being able to restrict access based on language is very useful since
  a translator might not be allowed to modify the original content. Also a
  translator currently needs create access while she is only going to extended
  an object which is already created.

One must be able to choose languages per access function. This means new policy
values for content/create and content/edit are required in order to define
languages.

- content/create : specify if user is allowed to create new object in specified
  language. 
- content/edit : specify if user has got access to edit the specified
  language(s) and create new translation for specified language(s).

To translate you need *content/read* and *content/edit* for the language to
translate into, this means users can translate objects without having
*content/create* rights.

View-cache
``````````

With the new multilanguage feature a view-cache is no longer made for one
specific language but for a prioritized list of languages, this means that the
directory storage must change. We replace the singular language code and
sitesdesign with the name of the site-access  e.g. if we have the languages
*nor-NO*, *eng-GB* and *ger-DE* in the site-access *no* we get::

  var/cache/no/full/

We also optimize the cleaning code to use the *glob* call with *GLOB_BRACE*
expansion, e.g::

  glob( "var/cache/{admin,mysite}/{full,line}/1/5/15-*.cache",
        GLOB_BRACE );

Doing this change will mean that we need to use AvailableSiteAccessList
(*site.ini*) when cleaning up caches. All of these changes can optimize the
::cleanup() method of the viewcache considerably while also giving proper
multi-language support.

Trash
`````

Currently objects are restored from trash by going to content/edit and then
getting a new version. This will not work very well with the new system where
there is only one language per version.

A new view in the content module will be made to handle restoration of trash
objects (content/restore). It will allow the user to restore to old location
or browser for a new location.

Cronjobs
````````

Cronjobs must be run with all languages enabled to ensure that they can reach
any object. The cronjob system will enable the global setting for the language
class which makes all subsequent operations fetch any object in the system
regardless of the language.


Configurability
```````````````

Currently the system will use the site-access settings to determine which
languages to fetch. However sometimes it is crucial to able to override this
per session or function call. This means that most fetches should have an
ability to choose the priority list.

Also a global variable must be set by index.php and cronjob.php which is used
by the system. The variable is set with the value from the site-access but can
be overridden by PHP code. e.g.::

  // update with correct INI names.
  $languages = $ini->variable( 'Language', 'PriorityList' );
  eZContentLanguage::setPrioritizedLanguages( $languages );

Fetching node/object lists
--------------------------

When fetching list (template fetch function) of nodes or objects it must be
possible to override the default language of the site-access. This can be used
to narrow down the languages or to fetch objects in languages normally not
accessible. The fetch function will get a parameter called *language_list*
which is an array of languages to act as the priority list (instead of the one
defined in site-access).

The existing parameters *only_translated* and *language* to the fetch functions
*content/list*, *content/tree*, *content/list_count* and *content/tree_count*
will be deprecated since they are not valid anymore. If they are used the
system will give a warning about it.

The treemenu() operator will also get the *language_list* parameter.

Clear API
`````````

Fetching the current language to use for one page request should be done from a
clean and simple API. It must be able to perform:

- Fetching the language settings for the site-access.
- Fetching the language settings for the page request (uses the global
  priority variable)

Site preferences
----------------

A new setting is added which controls what is the default language for the
site. This is used to determine the default choice in dropdowns or when
creating objects (when language has not been chosen). In addition each
site-access must be able to set the language priority list.

eZContentObject::defaultLanguage()
----------------------------------

This should be changed to return the languages based on the priority list.
Check the usage of this function, sometimes it might be that they want to use
*initial_language* for the object, e.g. for creating objects without having a
language specified.

User interface
``````````````

The user interface will need to updated because of the enhanced multilanguage
features. The main idea is to make it easier for the users to manage
translations.

List languages in draft list
----------------------------

Each language must show up as a separate entry in the draft list. The list will
pick the *edit_language* for the version. The user will not notice this
technical detail unless he looks at the URLs.

Creating and editing
--------------------

When creating a new object it should be possible to choose which language it
should be made from, for instance using a drop-down list. The default selection
should be the highest prioritized language of the site-access.

If the language was not specified in the url/variables (e.g. content/edit/5/5)
the system should go to a new page giving the user a choice over which language
to create in, this also has the default selected.

Editing should be similar as the create operation but with a dropdown (either
combobox or JS popup).

Editing multiple languages
--------------------------

Problem:
  Since you are only able to edit one object at a time it will be cumbersome
  for one person to make objects in multiple languages, e.g. the user might be
  fluent in two languages and can do the translation himself.

To ease the translation process it will still be able to edit two or more
translations (UI wise) at the same time, however the process will change from
earlier. Internally the system actually edits two versions of the same object
but the user should not be able to spot unless he examines the URLs.

Context menus
-------------

The JS popup menus must get an extra sub-meny, it contains the languages the
object can be edited in or the choice to create a new translation.

Extra considerations
````````````````````

While the ML features are implemented there are some considerations which needs
to be examined. They are explained here.

External patches
----------------

These external patches must be considered while implementing the ML features.

Temporary drafts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://pubsvn.ez.no/community/trunk/hacks/untoucheddrafts/patches/3.7.2/untoucheddrafts.patch

*Update 03.Apr.2006*: The temporary draft feature has been included in 3.8
together with the multi-language features.

Changes to existing functionality
`````````````````````````````````

While the multi-language features for 3.8 tried very hard to not change any
setting or interface which already present (only adding), there were some
points which needed changes, they are explained here:

content/action
--------------

Action AddAssignment/SelectAssignmentLocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This action no longer creates a new version of the object for adding a location
but instead creates the node immediately.

Action RemoveAssignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This action no longer accepts the POST variable *AssignmentIDSelection* which
contains list of node-assignment ids. Instead use the variable
*LocationIDSelection* and fill it with Node IDs.

The template *location.tpl* (admin) has alsoe been changed to use this new
variable and fetching locations from the node table and not node-assignments.


Outtakes
````````

Due to technical constraints the following items were not able to make it into
3.8.


URL aliases
-----------

Problem:
  Currently URL aliases are only built for one of the languages (the main
  language). For instance if you have a French site where you only show french
  translations of the URLs it is desirable to show the french URL alias for the
  users. The translated URL will point to the same internal URL but will use
  language priority to choose what to show.

Instead of introducing a new table for this or changing the subtree table, the
existing URL alias table is extended. This table will now have a new field
called *language_code* which tells which language the url is made for. The
system will then create/update these entries for all languages of an object
when it is published.

The table will look like::

  ezurlalias
  +---------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------+
  | destination_url           | language_id | path_id_string                       |
  +---------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------+
  | content/view/full/2       |           2 |                                      |
  | content/view/full/13      |          32 | folder_1/pingvinen_har_en_megafon    |
  | content/view/full/13      |           2 | folder_1/the_penguin_has_a_megaphone |
  +---------------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------+

The PHP class eZContentObjectTreeNode will have this translated url-alias
available as a function attribute (*localized_path*), if it is null in the
object it will fetch it from the DB. To avoid having to perform lost of
repeated SQL calls for each node all fetches nodes should be associated with
some collection, then we can go over the nodes in the collection and collect
multiple node IDs and use that for the SQL. (The existing cache system might
also suffice).

The fetch calls should get the possibility to fetch the name and path
immediately, this means that if you know you will use the name and/or path it
can be fetched in one go (after the main SQL). A new parameter is added to the
fetch functions for this.

The upgrade script must fill this table with info from the tree-node table for
each missing language. The existing script *"updateniceurls.php"* will be
extended with this.

Search engine
-------------

Problem:
  When searching you will always search in all languages, not only do you get
  too many objects in the result it will also not distinguish words which are
  the same in many languages but with different meaning. e.g. the word *to*
  exists in both English and Norwegian but has a different meaning.

Add *language_code* on word table, this will separate words per language and
solve the issue when one word exists in two or more languages but with
different meaning. Another issues it solves is when you search in specific
language and the word you are looking for does not exist in this language but
in other ones, then there is no need to include that in the search (it could
even tell the user that).

An example on how it could look::

  ezsearch_word
  +------+--------------+-------+-------------+
  | id   | object_count | word  | language_id |
  +------+--------------+-------+-------------+
  |    1 |            5 | to    |           2 |
  |    2 |            2 | to    |          32 |
  |    3 |            1 | kaker |          32 |
  |    4 |            1 | go    |           2 |
  +------+--------------+-------+-------------+

Search UI
---------

When searching it must be possible to override the default language of the
site-access. This can be used to narrow down the languages or to fetch objects
in languages normally not accessible.

The language must be able to be specified in two forms:

- Using a parameter to the search template fetch function.
- Using a GET/POST parameter from an HTML form.

The languages which can be chosen must be one of the languages defined in the
site-access.

Choosing translation per node
-----------------------------

Description:
The user should be able to choose which translation to use per placement. This
means that the priority list would change depending on which node is chosen,
e.g. the norwegian article is only shown in the norwegian subtree while the
