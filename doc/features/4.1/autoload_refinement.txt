Autoload refinement
===================

Usage of spl_autoload_register()
--------------------------------

eZ Publish now uses the autoload function stack in SPL to invoke autoload
methods. This also means that custom autoload methods can be added in
config.php.

If the the custom autoload method won't load eZ Publish's classes, the method
should check the class-prefix, or just return without exception if the class
is not found. The reason for this is that PHP will try each method in the
autoload stack, but it will stop if an exception is encountered higher up in
stack.

Each call to spl_autoload_register() will append the new method at the bottom
of the stack. PHP starts at the top, when looking for classes.
