How-To configure eZDFS cluster
==============================

About
=====

eZDFS stands for Distributed File System.

This handler's principle can be summarized as follows: cluster files are mainly
stored on NFS, while their metadata (size, mtime, expiry status) are maitained
in a DB table similar to the one used by eZDB.
NFS is used to read and write the reference copy of clusterized files. Cache
files will be copied locally when used by a frontend. Images & binary files
(when accessed directly via the browser) will be streamed directly from NFS.

eZDFS: Global architecture configuration
========================================
The most important aspects of architecture are the NFS mount point and the
cluster database.

Each instance of eZ publish sharing the same relational database has to use the
same cluster database, and each should have a local mount point to the same
NFS export, configured in the exact same way.

Example:
NFS-server:/exports/myvardir
eZpublish-server1:/var/www/var/nfsmount => mount of NFS-server:/exports/myvardir
eZpublish-server2:/var/www/var/nfsmount => mount of NFS-server:/exports/myvardir
eZpublish-server3:/var/www/var/nfsmount => mount of NFS-server:/exports/myvardir

The var directories should in NO CASE be shared among instances, since they will
automatically be synchronized. This is valid for both eZDB and eZDFS. The
cluster handlers take care of synchronizing data from/to the centralized
repository.

Creating the database structure
-------------------------------
The database structure required to hold clusterized files informations has to be
created. This table can be created either on the same MySQL server as the one
used for the relational database, or on a different one. For large scale
websites, a dedicated MySQL server can really improve performances.

The definition of this table can be found in the eZDFS MySQL driver class file
(kernel/private/classes/clusterfilehandlers/dfsbackends/mysql.php). It is
exactly the same as the one you can find below::

    CREATE TABLE ezdfsfile (
      `name` text NOT NULL,
      name_trunk text NOT NULL,
      name_hash varchar(34) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
      datatype varchar(60) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'application/octet-stream',
      scope varchar(25) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
      size bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
      mtime int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
      expired tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
      `status` tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
      PRIMARY KEY (name_hash),
      KEY ezdfsfile_name (`name`(250)),
      KEY ezdfsfile_name_trunk (name_trunk(250)),
      KEY ezdfsfile_mtime (mtime),
      KEY ezdfsfile_expired_name (expired,`name`(250))
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB;

NFS
---
Since eZDFS is based on NFS, a local mount point to a NFS server has to be
available & writeable by the webserver's user on each server that will use
eZ Publish.

How the mount points are configured depends on the software vendor of the NFS
solution.

Configuring the cluster handler
-------------------------------
Each eZ Publish instance that share the same var directory has to be configured
correctly in order to get the cluster handler working. Everything is configured
in file.ini (you should of course create a global override for this file).

Setting the cluster handler to eZDFS
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This is done by setting in file.ini the ClusteringSettings.FileHandler directive
to eZDFSFileHandler::

    # in settings/override/file.ini.append.php
    [ClusteringSettings]
    FileHandler=eZDFSFileHandler

Configuring the handler itself is done in the same file, in the INI block
eZDFSClusteringSettings. Most settings are self explanatory, but more details
are however available below::

    # in settings/override/file.ini.append.php
    [eZDFSClusteringSettings]
    # Path to the NFS mount point
    # Can be relative to the eZ publish root, or absolute.
    # The example below will work for a mount of NFS to the subdirectory
    # var/nfsmount in the eZ Publish root. Any location is possible
    MountPointPath=var/nfsmount

    # Database backend (only one available at the moment)
    DBBackend=eZDFSFileHandlerMySQLBackend
    # Hostname of the MySQL server where the ezdfsfile table lies
    DBHost=localhost
    # MySQL port
    DBPort=3306
    # Database name
    DBName=ezpublishcluster
    # Database user
    DBUser=ezpublish
    # Password for the user above
    DBPassword=ezpublish

Configuring the index_* files for clustering
--------------------------------------------

In order to make cluster files available via direct HTTP requests (images,
binary files, etc), it is required to use a configuration script and rewrite
rules.

The configuration scripts are included in the release. The one used by apache
to serve binary files request is index_cluster.php (included in the backport
release), and it will be referenced in the rewrite configuration.

This file contains configuration constants, and will include the file
index_image.php (part of the eZ Publish distribution) when executed. This file
will then include `index_image_dfscluster.php`, the final script that will read
and stream the files to the browser.

You will find below an example for index_cluster.php, matching the INI
configuration above (settings will usually match between INI and this file)::

    <?php
    // DFS parameters
    // the cluster handler name
    define( 'STORAGE_BACKEND', 'dfsmysql' );
    // database host (eZDFSClusteringSettings.DBHost)
    define( 'STORAGE_HOST', 'localhost' );
    // database user (eZDFSClusteringSettings.DBUser)
    define( 'STORAGE_USER', 'ezpublish' );
    // database user password (eZDFSClusteringSettings.DBPassword)
    define( 'STORAGE_PASS', 'ezpublish' );
    define( 'STORAGE_DB', 'ezpublishcluster' );
    define( 'MOUNT_POINT_PATH', 'var/nfsmount' );

    include_once( 'index_image.php' );
    ?>

Cluster rewrite rules
---------------------
mod_rewrite is mandatory to get the above index_cluster.php script to deliver
binary files & images. These rules are actually quite simple: they rewrite
every request for a content image / binary file to index_cluster.php, which
will then deliver the files directly through HTTP from the NFS server.

These rules are the same than the ones used for eZDB ( http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/4_0/features/clustering/setting_it_up ).
These rules can however be found below::

    RewriteEngine On

    Rewriterule ^/var/([^/]+/)?storage/images-versioned/.*  /index_cluster.php  [L]
    Rewriterule ^/var/([^/]+/)?storage/images/.*            /index_cluster.php  [L]

    # Other eZ Publish rewrite rules

These rules *have* to be found *before* the standard eZ Publish rewrite rules.

Note:
As for the standard cluster, it is more than strongly recommended to use some
sort of rewrite proxy to cache the binary files request, since these will
directly query DB (eZDB) / NFS+DB (eZDFS) and may lead to performance issues.

Clusterizing the files
----------------------
Once everything is correctly configured, binary data (image & files) have to
be clusterized.

This can be achieved using the clusterize.php script::

    php bin/php/clusterize.php -v

The script will push all the images found in ezimage and the binary files found
in ezbinaryfile to the ezdfsfile table (metadata), and the file themselves to
the configured NFS mount point.

*Note:* this process can take a long time depending on the amount of files
the eZ Publish instance contains. If the process is interrupted for any reason,
it can be safely restarted.

Clear the eZ Publish cache
--------------------------
Use the command line ezcache.php script::


    $ezpublishroot: php bin/php/ezcache.php --clear-all

If you are configuring multiple servers, execute this command on each server.

Troubleshooting
===============

Once everything has been configured and binary content has been clusterized,
testing can sometimes be complicated.

First, override the debug.ini file (to settings/override/file.ini.append.php),
and enable the kernel-clustering debug key::

    [GeneralCondition]
    kernel-clustering=enabled

It will present your with much more debug information regarding the cluster.
Refresh any page of your website. The page itself should work correctly.

If images are not displayed, it is most likely that something is wrong with
either your rewrite rules, or your index_cluster.php file. The best way to
locate the error is to load an image directly in the browser (usually using
the contextual menu on an image, and choosing "Open image in a new tab" or
similar). If a "Module not found" error is shown instead of the image, this
means that your rewrite rule is not correctly configured. If a PHP error is
shown, it means that your index_cluster.php configuration might be wrong.
