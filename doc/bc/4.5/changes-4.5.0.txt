Changes to BC and behavior in version 4.5.0
===========================================

Change of behavior
-----------------

- User object is not created until the user activates the account if activation is enabled.

  To support approval workflow for user/register, the object is not sent to publish until the user has clicked the activation.
  After a user clicks register, a user object draft will be created, then if the user clicks the activation, the object will be sent to publishing.
  Consequently, it's not possible view non-activated user from object view but possible from version view.
  This change might have affect on activation email template override.


Removed features
----------------

- Content views "diff" and "versions" have been removed.

  They have been deprecated in 3.9 in favor of the combined view "history".

Removed constants
-----------------

- eZINI::DEBUG_INTERNALS

  This constant, previously set to false, was for internal use only and
  represented the initial and default value of eZINI::setIsDebugEnabled()
  and eZINI::isDebugEnabled() methods.

Removed globals
---------------

- eZINIGlobalInstance-*

  eZINI now uses a protected static variable to keep track of eZINI instances.
  Use eZINI::resetAllGlobals( false ); to clear them if needed.

- eZINICacheEnabled, eZINIDebugInternalsEnabled and eZINITextCodecEnabled

  eZINI now uses a protected static variable to keep track of those global
  status.
