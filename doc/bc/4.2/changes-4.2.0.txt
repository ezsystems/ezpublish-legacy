Changes to BC and behaviour in version 4.2.0
============================================

INI setting changes
-------------------

image.ini
  [AnimatedGIF]
  DisallowedFilters[] defaults to empty
  AllowedFilters[] defaults to geometry/*
  This change is to ensure that animated GIFs can be resized using default settings.
  Also implemented in 4.1.4 and 4.0.7.


Change of behaviour
-------------------

- eZLDAPUser::loginUser

  ldap.ini setting LDAPFollowReferrals is introduced and set to 0 by default as
  ldap code did not work with most AD setups. LDAP_OPT_REFERRALS was earlier not
  set at all, thus enabled.


Renamed methods
---------------

- eZSoapRequest::namespace() -> eZSoapRequest::ns()

  Renamed for php 5.3 support, see issue #13825.
