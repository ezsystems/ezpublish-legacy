What is eZ Publish?

eZ Publish is a professional PHP application framework with advanced CMS
(content management system) functionality. As a CMS its most notable feature
is its fully customizable and extendable content model.
It is also suitable as a platform for general PHP development, allowing
you to develop professional Internet applications, fast.

Standard CMS functionality, like news publishing, e-commerce and forums is
built in and ready for you to use. Its stand-alone libraries can be
