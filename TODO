KNOWN ISSUES:

* Links on embed object tags ( not possible on div tags, needs to change it or document that it won't work unless you define class as image )
* IE / Opera freaks out on inline customtags (when you inser or update html)
* update translations





KNOWN ENHANCEMENT REQUESTS:

* Custimizable formats selector (custom tags and classes)
* Better feedback on custom attribute validation ( fork TinyMCE validation and enhance it? )
* Re add bookmarks when selecting images / objects
