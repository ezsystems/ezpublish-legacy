What is eZ Publish?
-------------------
eZ Publish is a professional PHP application framework with advanced CMS
(content management system) functionality. As a CMS it's most notable feature
is its revolutionary, fully customizable and extendable content model. This is
also what makes it suitable as a platform for general PHP development, allowing
you to develop professional Internet applications fast.

Standard CMS functionality, like news publishing, e-commerce and forums is
already implemented and ready for you to use. Its stand-alone libraries can be
used for cross-platform, database independent PHP projects.

eZ Publish is database, platform and browser independent. Because it is
browser based it can be used and updated from anywhere as long as you have
access to the Internet.
