What is eZ publish?
-------------------
eZ publish 3 is a professional PHP application framework with advanced CMS
(content management system) functionality. As a CMS it's most notable feature
is its revolutionary, fully customizable and extendable content model. This is
also what makes it suitable as a platform for general PHP development, allowing

used for cross-platform, database independent PHP projects.
