#A list of extensions which have binaryhandlers
#It's common to create a settings/file.ini.append.php file
#in your extension and add the extension name to automatically
#get handlers from the extension when it's turned on.
#Handlers need to be placed in the extension subdir "binaryhandlers".

# Cluster file handler.
# Since 4.1 name of the filehandlers have changed
# you may choose between :
# - eZFSFileHandler
#   standard file handler
# - eZDFSFileHandler
#   distributed filesystem handler with a DB overlay. Required for NFS based
#   architectures
# and it is case sensitive
FileHandler=eZFSFileHandler

# DEPRECATED
# If you want to use your own cluster file handler located in an extension
# then you should add the extension name to the list below.
# In that case the handler will be searched for in the following directory:
# extension/<your_extension>/clusterfilehandlers

# Defines what happens when a requested cache file is already being generated
# and no expired cache file exists (for instance if the content is new)
# Two possible values:
#   - wait: places the process in a wait loop for a limited time until the file
#           is done generating. This is the default value
#   - generate: let the requesting process generate its own data without storing
#               the result
# The key of this array defined the type of cache impacted by the setting. Three
# cache types are allowed here: viewcache, cacheblock and misc (any cache that is
# not viewcache nor cacheblock).
