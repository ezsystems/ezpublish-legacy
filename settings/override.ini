# NOTE: It is not recommended to edit this files directly, instead
#       a file in override should be created for setting the
#       values that is required for your site. Either create
#       a file called settings/override/override.ini.append or
#       settings/override/override.ini.append.php for more security
#       in non-virtualhost modes (the .php file may already be present
#       and can be used for this purpose).

# in settings/siteaccess/myaccess/override.ini.append

# common for all siteaccesses
